### About This Project

#### This is an application that allows the user to manage his passwords. The user can input and save their passwords. After a password is saved the user can use the search functionality to find saved passwords.

#### The UI was created using Tkinter. I used grid for the ui layout. The saving/storing/reading information part of the application is done using json. The pyperclip module was also utilized to auto copy the password into the clipboard. You can view this application live by clicking [this link.](https://repl.it/@ArisRoutsis/Password-Manager#main.py)

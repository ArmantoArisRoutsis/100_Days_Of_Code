### About This Project

#### This is an application that allows the user to manage his passwords. The user can input and save their passwords. After a password is saved the user can use the search functionality to find saved passwords.

#### The UI was created using Tkinter. I used grid for the ui layout. The saving/storing/reading information part of the application is done using json. You can view this application live by clicking [this link.](https://repl.it/@ArisRoutsis/Password-Manager#main.py)

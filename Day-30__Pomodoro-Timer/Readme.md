### About This Project

#### This is a simple application that the user can use to manage their studying time more efficiently. The timer will run for 25 minutes and then it will tell the users that its a time for a 5 minute break. If the user completes five 25 minute sessions succesfully then the application will tell them that they can now take a longer 20 minute break. The UI of this application was made using Tkinter. You can view this application live by clicking [this link.](https://repl.it/@ArisRoutsis/Pomodoro-Timer#main.py)
